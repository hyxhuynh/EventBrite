# EventBrite
An app built based on EventBrite inspiration

The EventBrite API builds models for an Event, Type, Category, Event City, and Event Zip Code, to create a database connecting the information and eventually allowing users to search for different events by their corresponding type, category, zip code, and city. 
Event properties such as name, description, and date/time are written out in the CatalogSeed to allow the user to gather more information about each event specifically and pictures
are associated with each event as well.
